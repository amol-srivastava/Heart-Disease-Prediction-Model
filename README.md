# Heart-Disease-Project
## End to End Heart Disease Prediction Project Using Machine Learning 
### Predicting Heart Disease Using Machine Learning
#### This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the application of various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries to predict whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.

##Overview
#### The notebook guides through a structured workflow for building a machine learning model capable of predicting heart disease from clinical parameters. The process includes data preparation, exploratory data analysis, model building, and evaluation with an emphasis on creating a robust machine learning pipeline.

## Steps and Features
### Problem Definition: Predict the presence of heart disease from clinical parameters.
### Data Exploration: Understand the dataset involving attributes like age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.
### Modeling: Utilize logistic regression to model the data.
### Evaluation: Assess the model using metrics like ROC curve, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
### Experimentation: Tune and refine the model for better accuracy.
### Tools Used
#### Python: A powerful programming language for handling data and performing complex calculations.
#### Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning tasks.
## How to Use
### Clone the repository.
#### Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed or use Google Colab to open the .ipynb file.
#### Run the notebook cells sequentially to understand the workflow and results.
