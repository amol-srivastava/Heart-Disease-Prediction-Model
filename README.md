# Heart Disease Prediction Project

## Overview

This repository hosts a comprehensive Jupyter notebook demonstrating an end-to-end project using Python-based machine learning and data science libraries to predict heart disease based on medical attributes.

### What is inside?

The notebook includes detailed steps from data preparation to advanced model evaluation, forming a robust machine learning pipeline capable of predicting the presence of heart disease from clinical parameters.
