# Heart Disease Prediction Project

## Overview# Heart Disease Prediction Project

## Overview

This repository hosts a comprehensive Jupyter notebook demonstrating an end-to-end project using Python-based machine learning and data science libraries to predict heart disease based on medical attributes.

### What is inside?

The notebook includes detailed steps from data preparation to advanced model evaluation, forming a robust machine learning pipeline capable of predicting the presence of heart disease from clinical parameters.

## Steps and Features

- **Problem Definition**: Identify whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical profile.
- **Data Exploration**: Analyze the dataset with attributes like age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.

- **Experimentation**: Refine the model through various tuning techniques to improve accuracy.

## Tools Used

- **Python**: The core programming language used for handling data and calculations.
- **Libraries**:
  - **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation.
  - **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization.
  - **Scikit-Learn** for implementing machine learning models.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**: Download the project to your local machine.
2. **Set up your environment**:
   - Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed, or use Google Colab to view the `.ipynb` file.
3. **Run the notebook**: Execute the notebook cells in sequence to visualize the data processing and results.
